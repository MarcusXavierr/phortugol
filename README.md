# Phortugol, a simple portugol interpreter written in PHP

This project aims to implement a version of portugol similar to javascript

To run the interpreter, you need to have PHP 8.2 or greater installed on your system, and composer too.

To install the dependencies (none until now), run:

```bash
composer install
```
To run the interpreter, run:

```bash
./main.php <filename>
```
or simply run the interpreter without any arguments to enter the REPL mode, like this:

```bash
./main.php
```
