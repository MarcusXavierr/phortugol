# ToyJS, a simple JavaScript interpreter written in PHP

This is a toy JavaScript interpreter written in PHP. It is not complete and not fully compliant with the ECMAScript standard. It is intended for educational purposes only.

To run the interpreter, you need to have PHP 8.2 or greater installed on your system, and composer too.

To install the dependencies (none until now), run:

```bash
composer install
```
To run the interpreter, run:

```bash
./main.php <filename>
```
or simply run the interpreter without any arguments to enter the REPL mode, like this:

```bash
./main.php
```
